# Text Classification with Messy Data

A comprehensive machine learning solution for classifying messy social media text into categories: sports, politics, tech, food, and entertainment.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Train a machine learning model to classify sentences into 5 categories despite messy text containing:
- Random capitalization (DEbATinG, SMartpHONE)
- Emojis (🍔, 😂, 🔥, 💯)
- Extra spaces and special characters
- Repeated characters (BuGZzZ, SoOo)
- Slang and informal language

## 📊 Dataset
