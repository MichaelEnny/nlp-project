## Executive Summary

This project successfully developed a robust text classification system capable of categorizing messy social media text into 5 categories (sports, politics, tech, food, entertainment) with **100% accuracy**. The solution demonstrates that proper text preprocessing is crucial for handling real-world messy data, achieving significant performance improvements over baseline approaches.

## 1. Approach

### 1.1 Problem Analysis
The challenge involved classifying text samples containing multiple types of messiness:
- **Random capitalization**: DEbATinG, SMartpHONE, BuRgER
- **Emojis**: üçî, üòÇ, üî•, üíØ, üôÑ
- **Extra spaces and special characters**: Multiple spaces, tildes (~~~)
- **Repeated characters**: BuGZzZ, SoOo, LOl
- **Informal language**: Slang, abbreviations, social media style

### 1.2 Solution Architecture
Developed a comprehensive pipeline with 8 main components:

1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding dataset structure and messiness patterns
2. **Messiness Analysis**: Systematic identification of text quality issues
3. **Text Preprocessing**: Multi-stage cleaning pipeline

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Text Preprocessing Pipeline
Implemented a comprehensive cleaning pipeline:

```python
Text ‚Üí Emoji Removal ‚Üí Whitespace Normalization ‚Üí Lowercasing ‚Üí
Character Deduplication ‚Üí Special Character Removal ‚Üí Tokenization ‚Üí
Stopword Removal ‚Üí Lemmatization ‚Üí Short Word Filtering ‚Üí Clean Text
```

**Key preprocessing steps:**
- **Emoji handling**: Removed Unicode emoji characters (ranges U+1F600-U+1F9FF)
- **Case normalization**: Converted to lowercase for consistency
- **Space cleanup**: Collapsed multiple spaces to single spaces
- **Character deduplication**: Reduced repeated characters (e.g., "sooo" ‚Üí "soo")
- **Tokenization**: Split text into individual words
- **Stopword removal**: Removed common English stopwords
- **Lemmatization**: Reduced words to base forms

### 2.2 Feature Engineering
Developed three complementary feature representations:

1. **Bag of Words (BOW)**:
   - Simple word frequency counting
   - N-gram range: 1-2 (unigrams and bigrams)
   - Vocabulary size: 5,000 features

2. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**:
   - Weighted term importance based on document frequency
   - N-gram range: 1-2
   - Sublinear TF scaling applied
   - Vocabulary size: 5,000 features

3. **Character-level TF-IDF**:
   - Character n-gram features (2-4 character sequences)
   - Robust to spelling variations and typos
   - Vocabulary size: 3,000 features

### 2.3 Model Selection and Training
Evaluated four machine learning algorithms:

1. **Logistic Regression**: Linear classifier with regularization
2. **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: Probabilistic classifier for text
3. **Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees
4. **Support Vector Machine (Linear)**: Maximum margin classifier

**Training methodology:**
- **Data split**: 80% training, 20% testing
